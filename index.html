           <h2>Description</h2>
           <p>Flappy is a game where player controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of green pipes without hitting them. There are three levels of difficulty in this game. The speed and the distance between pipes are changed across the levels of difficulty. Hard level introduces new feature - a surprising change of the hero! It's very big and awkward so it will not be easy. Also, the player has three lives. Each time player hits the pipe, the player loses one life. The game lasts until he has no lives.</p>
